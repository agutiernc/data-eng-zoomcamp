# Module 4 Homework 

In this homework, we'll use the models developed during the week 4 videos and enhance the already presented dbt project using the already loaded Taxi data for fhv vehicles for year 2019 in our DWH.

This means that in this homework we use the following data [Datasets list](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/)
* Yellow taxi data - Years 2019 and 2020
* Green taxi data - Years 2019 and 2020 
* fhv data - Year 2019. 

We will use the data loaded for:

* Building a source table: `stg_fhv_tripdata`
* Building a fact table: `fact_fhv_trips`
* Create a dashboard 

If you don't have access to GCP, you can do this locally using the ingested data from your Postgres database
instead. If you have access to GCP, you don't need to do it for local Postgres - only if you want to.
